# Project Overview

This Flask web application is designed for basic linear optimization tasks. It provides users with an interface to input optimization problems and receive solutions using linear programming techniques.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to offer a user-friendly platform for users to solve linear programming problems without needing in-depth knowledge of optimization algorithms. By utilizing Flask, this application aims to simplify the optimization process, making it accessible to a broader audience.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MafuMQ/ex2-LO.git
   cd ex2-LO
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the app.

## Example Usage
1. Navigate to the home page of the web app.
2. Input your linear optimization problem in the provided form.
3. Submit the form to view the optimal solution and other relevant output.

Customers and stakeholders can effectively leverage this tool for various linear optimization needs, from academic purposes to practical business applications.
